## Front-End Engineer

I'm a Front-End Engineer with a unique background: I like to talk about fitness and books as much as I like algorithms and OOP. I have over 3 years of experience of coding expertise, I always encourage following good practices in regards to software development and web accessibility.

I've built web applications using the following technologies:

- Angular
- RxJS
- React
- Redux
- Next

Despite the fact that I'm on the Front-End Engineering side, I'm learning about Nest JS in order to be able to build an entire web platform, I know the basics of Back-End Engineering but I'm broading my knowledge to come up with better solutions by understanding all the spectrum.

If you would like to know more, send me an email and we can chat.
