# Yosef Enmanuel Blandin Rios

I’m a Frontend Engineer with 4+ years of experience crafting high-performance UIs in multiple industries. My work focuses on building robust platforms, real-time dashboards, and data-driven charts using React, Next.js, and TypeScript.

I specialize in translating complex financial data into clean, intuitive interfaces—whether it's regulatory dashboards, trading insights, or internal analytics tools. I’ve worked with tools like Recharts, D3.js, and Chart.js, and I follow best practices in modular design, performance optimization, and scalable architecture.

If you're building a fintech platform or need a fast, interactive, and reliable frontend for your data-rich product—let’s connect.
