## Frontend Developer

I'm a Frontend Developer with a unique background: I like to talk about fitness and books as much as I like algorithms and OOP. I have over 3 years of experience of coding expertise, I always encourage following good practices in regards to software development and web accessibility.

I've built web applications using the following technologies:

- Angular
- RxJS
- React
- Redux
- Next
